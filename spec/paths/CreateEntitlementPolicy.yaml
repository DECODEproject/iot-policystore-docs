  summary: Create a community policy
  description: >
    This endpoint is the method by which a community administrator should be
    able to create a new policy which defines a specific community. In order to
    call this endpoint the admin will have to have previously interacted with
    the Credential Issuing service in order to create an `Authorizable
    Attribute` for the community.


    For more details on this please see the documentation of the Coconut
    protocol and the credential issuing service.
